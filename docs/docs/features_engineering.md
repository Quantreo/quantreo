## **Candle Information**
You can find a series of examples on how to create these features in the [educational notebooks](https://www.quantreo.com) provided by [Quantreo](https://www.quantreo.com).


``` py
from quantreo.features_engineering import candle
```

### **Basic Candle Information**

The `candle_information` function provides essential insights about a candle by calculating the following features:

- **The Candle Way**: This feature returns `-1` if the candle is red (indicating a negative variation from the open price to the close price) or `1` if the candle is green (indicating a positive variation from the open price to the close price).

- **The Filling**: This feature computes the ratio between the absolute difference from the open to the close price and the total range of the candle (i.e., the difference between the high and low prices). $\frac{| \text{close} - \text{open} |}{| \text{high} - \text{low} |}$

- **The Amplitude**: This feature measures the relative price movement of a candle compared to its average. $\frac{| \text{close} - \text{open} |}{\left( \frac{\text{open} + \text{close}}{2} \right)}$


```python
def candle_information(df: pd.DataFrame, open_col: str = 'open', high_col: str = 'high',
                       low_col: str = 'low', close_col: str = 'close') 
                       -> Tuple[pd.Series, pd.Series, pd.Series]:
    """
    Compute candle information indicators for a given OHLC DataFrame.

    This function calculates:
      - 'candle_way': Indicator for the candle's color (1 if close > open, -1 otherwise).
      - 'filling': The filling percentage, computed as the absolute difference between
                   close and open divided by the range (high - low).
      - 'amplitude': The candle amplitude as a percentage, calculated as the absolute difference
                     between close and open divided by the average of open and close, multiplied by 100.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame containing OHLC data.
    open_col : str, optional
        Column name for open prices (default is 'open').
    high_col : str, optional
        Column name for high prices (default is 'high').
    low_col : str, optional
        Column name for low prices (default is 'low').
    close_col : str, optional
        Column name for close prices (default is 'close').

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[pd.Series, pd.Series, pd.Series]
        - candle_way (pd.Series[int]): The direction of the candle (`1` for bullish, `-1` for bearish).
        - filling (pd.Series[float]): The proportion of the candle range occupied by the body.
        - amplitude (pd.Series[float]): The relative size of the candle in percentage.
    """
```

ðŸ“¢ "For a practical example, check out the [educational notebook](examples/Features_Engineering_Candle.ipynb)."

!!! tip "Tip"
    These three variables (`candle_way`, `filling` and `amplitude`) are often very correlated. Do not hesitate to keep only the best feature related to your problem or combine them smartly into one variable.

### **Spread Calculation**

The `compute_spread` function provides a simple yet valuable insight into the **difference between the highest and lowest price** within a given period. This metric is useful for analyzing intra-bar market volatility.

  $$ \text{spread} = \text{high} - \text{low} $$

The higher the `spread` value is, the more the market is volatile.

```python
def compute_spread(df: pd.DataFrame, high_col: str = 'high', low_col: str = 'low') -> pd.Series:
    """
    Compute the spread between the high and low price columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        The DataFrame containing price data.
    high_col : str, optional
        Column name for the high prices (default is 'high').
    low_col : str, optional
        Column name for the low prices (default is 'low').

    Returns
    -------
    spread_series : pandas.Series
        A Series indexed the same as `df`, containing the spread values.
    """
```

## **Volatility**

``` py
from quantreo.features_engineering import volatility
```

### **Parkinson Volatility**

The `parkinson_volatility` function computes the **Parkinson volatility**, an estimator designed to measure market volatility using only **high and low prices**. This approach provides a more accurate estimate than simple **close-to-close volatility**, particularly in **markets with low closing price variation but significant intraday movement**.

!!! tip "Tip"
    Unlike standard volatility measures, the **Parkinson estimator** is a **rolling volatility measure**, meaning that at each time step, the function calculates the volatility over the **last N observations**, producing a **time series of volatility values**.

The **Parkinson estimator** is defined as:

\[
\sigma_P^2 = \frac{1}{4N \ln(2)} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \ln \frac{h_i}{l_i} \right)^2
\]

*(Source: Parkinson, 1980, "The Extreme Value Method for Estimating the Variance of the Rate of Return")*

Where:

- **\(h_i\)**: The **high price** at time \(i\).
- **\(l_i\)**: The **low price** at time \(i\).
- **\(N\)**: The number of periods in the rolling window.

!!! important "Important"
    This estimator is **more accurate than close-to-close volatility** because it:

    âœ” Uses **high and low prices**, which contain more information than just closing prices.  
    âœ” Provides a **rolling measure of volatility**, making it suitable for **time-series analysis**.  
    âœ” Assumes that price movements follow a **Brownian motion** without drift.  

```python
def parkinson_volatility(df: pd.DataFrame, window_size: int = 30, high_col: str = 'high', low_col: str = 'low')\
                        -> pd.Series:
    """
    Calculate Parkinson's volatility estimator using numpy operations with Numba acceleration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame containing the price data.
    window_size : int, optional
        The number of periods to include in the rolling calculation (default is 30).
    high_col : str, optional
        Column name for the high prices (default is 'high').
    low_col : str, optional
        Column name for the low prices (default is 'low').

    Returns
    -------
    volatility_series : pandas.Series
        A Series indexed the same as `df`, containing the rolling Parkinson volatility.
        The first `window_size` rows will be NaN because there is insufficient data
        to compute the volatility in those windows.
    """
```

### **Rogers-Satchell Volatility**
The `rogers_satchell_volatility` function computes the **Rogers-Satchell volatility**, an estimator designed specifically for **assets with a directional drift**, making it more suitable for financial markets than standard measures like **close-to-close volatility**.

!!! tip "Tip"
    Unlike standard volatility measures, the **Rogers-Satchell estimator** is a **rolling volatility** measure, meaning that at each time step, the function calculates the volatility over the **last N observations**, producing a **time series of volatility values**.

The **Rogers-Satchell estimator** is defined as:

\[
\sigma_{RS}^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \ln (\frac{h_i}{c_i}) \ln (\frac{h_i}{o_i}) + \ln (\frac{l_i}{c_i}) \ln (\frac{l_i}{o_i}) \right)
\]

*(Source: Rogers & Satchell, 1994, "Estimating Variance from High, Low, and Close Prices")*

Where:

- **\(h_i\)**: The **high price** at time \(i\).
- **\(l_i\)**: The **low price** at time \(i\).
- **\(o_i\)**: The **open price** at time \(i\).
- **\(c_i\)**: The **close price** at time \(i\).
- **\(N\)**: The number of periods in the rolling window.

!!! important "Important"
    This estimator is **more accurate than standard close-to-close volatility** because it:

    âœ” Incorporates **intraday high and low prices**, providing a better estimate of actual price movement.  
    âœ” Does not assume zero drift, making it more applicable to **trending markets**.  
    âœ” Is **computationally efficient** while reducing bias in the variance estimate.  

```python
def rogers_satchell_volatility(df: pd.DataFrame, window_size: int = 30, high_col: str = 'high',
                               low_col: str = 'low', open_col: str = 'open', close_col: str = 'close') -> pd.Series:
    """

        The number of periods used in the rolling calculation (default = 30).
    high_col : str, optional
        Column name for high prices (default = 'high').
    low_col : str, optional
        Column name for low prices (default = 'low').
    open_col : str, optional
        Column name for open prices (default = 'open').
    close_col : str, optional
        Column name for close prices (default = 'close').

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series
        A Series containing the rolling Rogers-Satchell volatility, indexed like `df`.
        The first `window_size` rows are NaN due to insufficient data.
    """

### **Yang-Zhang Volatility Estimator**

The `yang_zhang_volatility` function computes the **Yang-Zhang volatility**, an advanced estimator that integrates **overnight, close-to-close, and intra-day price movements**. This method is particularly useful for assets with **significant overnight gaps**, making it more robust than traditional measures.

!!! tip "Tip"
    Unlike standard volatility measures, the **Yang-Zhang estimator** is a **rolling volatility measure**, meaning that at each time step, the function calculates the volatility over the **last N observations**, producing a **time series of volatility values**.


The **Yang-Zhang estimator** is defined as:

\[
\sigma_t = \sqrt{\sigma_O^2 + k\sigma_C^2 + (1 - k) \sigma_{RS}^2}
\]

*(Source: Yang & Zhang, 2000, "Drift Independent Volatility Estimation")*

Where:

- **\(\sigma_O^2\)**: The **overnight volatility**, measuring the variance between **close-to-open** prices.
- **\(\sigma_C^2\)**: The **close-to-close volatility**, capturing daily price changes.
- **\(\sigma_{RS}^2\)**: The **Rogers-Satchell estimator**, which accounts for intra-day price movements.
- **\(k\)**: A weighting factor empirically determined by Yang & Zhang, according to them, the best empirical value is 0.34.

!!! important "Important"
    This estimator is **more accurate than simple close-to-close volatility** because it:

    âœ” Reduces bias from opening gaps.  
    âœ” Accounts for intra-day price fluctuations.  
    âœ” Provides a better measure of realized volatility.

```python
def yang_zhang_volatility(df: pd.DataFrame, window_size: int = 30, high_col: str = 'high', low_col: str = 'low',
                          open_col: str = 'open', close_col: str = 'close', k: float = 0.34) -> pd.Series:
    """
