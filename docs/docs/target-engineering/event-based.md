# **Event-Based Targets**
You can find several examples on how to create these targets in the [educational notebooks](/../tutorials/target-engineering-event-based) provided by Quantreo.

```python
import quantreo.target_engineering as te
```

## **Peaks & Valleys Detection**

The `detect_peaks_valleys` function identifies **structural turning points** in a price series by labeling **local maxima (peaks)** and **local minima (valleys)**. It is particularly useful to define event-driven targets that are independent of fixed time intervals.

- The function returns a label of `1` for a **peak**, `-1` for a **valley**, and `0` elsewhere.
- Internally, it leverages `scipy.signal.find_peaks` for robustness.

!!! tip "Tip"
    You can combine this function with magnitude-based targets like `future_returns()` to detect **how strong the move is after a turning point**.

=== "Function"
    ```python
    te.event_based.detect_peaks_valleys(df: pd.DataFrame, col: str = 'close', **kwargs)
    ```

=== "Docstring"
    ```python
    """
    Detect peaks and valleys in a time series using scipy's find_peaks.
    
    This function labels turning points in a price series:
    - 1 for local maxima (**peaks**),
    - -1 for local minima (**valleys**),
    - 0 for all other points.
    
    It internally uses `scipy.signal.find_peaks` for both peak and valley detection.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame containing the price data.
    col : str, optional
        The column name of the series to analyze (default is 'close').
    **kwargs :
            Additional keyword arguments passed directly to scipy.signal.find_peaks
            (e.g., distance=5, prominence=0.5, wlen=20, height=1.0, etc.)
    
    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series
        A Series of labels with the same index as `df`:
        - 1 for peaks,
        - -1 for valleys,
        - 0 for neutral points.
    """
    ```

=== "Example"
    ```python
    df["label"] = te.event_based.detect_peaks_valleys(df, col='close', distance=10, prominence=1)
    ```
