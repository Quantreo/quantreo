<br>

Quantreo provides a high-performance research framework for building features, targets, and alternative bars in Python.
Its goal is to help quantitative researchers transform raw market data into machine-learning-ready datasets quickly, efficiently, and without data leakage.

Each module is built around the principles of clarity, reproducibility, and performance, using Numba for just-in-time optimization.
Whether your goal is alpha research, backtesting, or production-ready model development, Quantreo offers a consistent and modular workflow.

## Main Packages

Quantreo is built for quantitative research, Numba-optimized, leakage-safe, and fully compatible with pandas and scikit-learn,
ensuring fast and reproducible data transformations across all modules.

| Package                                                      | Purpose | Example Capabilities |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------|:---------|:--------------------|
| [`Data Aggregation`](/data-aggregation/Get-Started/)         | Transform raw tick data into structured OHLCV bars | Time bars, tick bars, volume bars, run bars |
| [`Features Engineering`](/features-engineering/Get-Started/) | Extract predictive information from price and volume | Volatility, entropy, trend, statistical structure |
| [`Target Engineering`](/target-engineering/Get-Started/)      | Build machine-learning targets without data leakage | Triple-barrier, meta-labeling, event-based labeling |

Each module can be used independently or combined into a complete research pipeline, from raw data to model-ready datasets.

## Installation

Quantreo is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/quantreo/) and can be installed with `pip`:

```bash
pip install quantreo
```

To verify your installation:

```python
import quantreo
print(quantreo.__version__)
```

---
## Quick Start
Compute a ready-to-use volatility feature in just two lines.

```python
import quantreo.features_engineering as fe

df["parkinson_vol"] = fe.volatility.parkinson_volatility(df=df, high_col="high",
                                                         low_col="low", window_size=30)
```
Then, you can easily visualize your computed feature to check its behavior over time:
