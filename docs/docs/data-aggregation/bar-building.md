# **Bar Building**
You can find a series of examples on how to create bar aggregations from tick data in the [educational notebooks](/../tutorials/data-aggregation-bar-building) provided by Quantreo.

```py
import quantreo.data_aggregation as da
```

!!! danger "Input Requirements"
    To use these functions, your input `DataFrame` must:

    - Be indexed by a **`DatetimeIndex`** (typically named `"datetime"`).
    - Contain at least two columns:
      - **`price`** â€“ the transaction price of each tick.
      - **`volume`** â€“ the size of the trade (*can be set to `0` if unknown, but must be present*).

## **Ticks to Time Bars**

The `ticks_to_time_bars` function aggregates raw tick data into **fixed-time bars** (e.g., 1-second, 1-minute, etc.). This is the most common form of bar construction, used in nearly all trading platforms.

The function will group ticks by time intervals and compute **OHLCV** values per bar.

It is also possible to add **custom metrics** to each bar using the `additional_metrics` parameter, see the [dedicated tutorial](/../data-aggregation/bar-metrics/#custom-metrics) for a detailed walkthrough.

=== "Function"
    ```python
    def ticks_to_time_bars(df: pd.DataFrame, col_price: str = "price", col_volume: str = "volume", resample_factor: str = "60min",
        additional_metrics: List[Tuple[Callable, str, List[str]]] = []) -> pd.DataFrame
    ```
=== "Docstring"
    ```python
    """
    Convert tick-level data into fixed-time bars using Numba, with optional additional metrics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame indexed by datetime, containing at least price and volume columns.
    col_price : str
        Name of the column containing tick prices.
    col_volume : str
        Name of the column containing tick volumes.
    resample_factor : str
        Resampling frequency (e.g., "1min", "5min", "1H", "1D").
    additional_metrics : List[Tuple[Callable, str, List[str]]]
        Each element is a tuple of:
        - a function applied to bar slices,
        - the source: "price", "volume", or "price_volume",
        - output column names.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        Time bars indexed by period start time with OHLCV, tick count, and custom metrics.
    """
    ```
=== "Example"
    ```python
    time_bars = da.bar_building.ticks_to_time_bars(df=ticks, resample_factor="4H", col_price="price", col_volume="volume")
    ```

## **Ticks to Tick Bars**

The `ticks_to_tick_bars` function aggregates raw tick data into **fixed-size tick bars**, where each bar contains exactly *N* ticks (e.g., 1,000 ticks per bar). This method preserves microstructure details by standardizing the number of observations per bar rather than the time interval.

The function will sequentially split ticks into equal-sized chunks and compute **OHLCV** values, tick count, duration, and extrema timestamps for each bar.

It is also possible to add **custom metrics** to each bar using the `additional_metrics` parameter, see the [dedicated tutorial](/../data-aggregation/bar-metrics/#custom-metrics) for a detailed walkthrough.

This type of bars comes from the book "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" (Marco Lopez de Prado)

=== "Function"
    ```python
    def ticks_to_tick_bars(df: pd.DataFrame, tick_per_bar: int = 1000, col_price: str = "price", col_volume: str = "volume",
        additional_metrics: List[Tuple[Callable, str, List[str]]] = []) -> pd.DataFrame
    ```
=== "Docstring"
    ```python
    """
    Convert tick-level data into fixed-size tick bars, with optional additional metrics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        Tick DataFrame indexed by datetime, must include price and volume columns.
    tick_per_bar : int, default=1000
        Number of ticks per bar.
    col_price : str
        Name of the column containing tick prices.
    col_volume : str

## **Ticks to Volume Bars**

The `ticks_to_volume_bars` function aggregates raw tick data into bars based on **cumulative traded volume**. A new bar is created every time the specified `volume_per_bar` threshold is reached. This method adapts to market activity: more bars during high activity, fewer during quiet periods.

The function sequentially accumulates volume and computes **OHLCV**, tick count, duration, and extrema timestamps for each volume bar.

It is also possible to add **custom metrics** to each bar using the `additional_metrics` parameter, see the [dedicated tutorial](/../data-aggregation/bar-metrics/#custom-metrics) for a detailed walkthrough.

This type of bars comes from the book "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" (Marco Lopez de Prado)

=== "Function"
    ```python
    def ticks_to_volume_bars(df: pd.DataFrame, volume_per_bar: float = 1_000_000, col_price: str = "price", col_volume: str = "volume",
        additional_metrics: List[Tuple[Callable, str, List[str]]] = []) -> pd.DataFrame
    ```
=== "Docstring"
    ```python
    """
    Convert tick-level data into volume-based bars, optionally enriched with custom metrics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        Tick DataFrame indexed by datetime, must include price and volume columns.
    volume_per_bar : float
        Volume threshold triggering a new bar.
    col_price : str
        Column name representing the price of each tick.
    col_volume : str
        Column name representing the volume of each tick.
    additional_metrics : List[Tuple[Callable, str, List[str]]]
        Optional custom metrics.

    Returns

## **Ticks to Tick Imbalance Bars**

The `ticks_to_tick_imbalance_bars` function builds bars based on the **signed tick imbalance**. Unlike time-based or volume-based bars, a new bar is triggered only when the **cumulative imbalance between buyer-initiated and seller-initiated ticks** exceeds a predefined threshold.

This technique helps normalize market activity by emphasizing **price pressure** rather than time or volume, which is particularly useful for **event-driven strategies** or volatile markets.

The function computes **OHLCV**, tick count, duration, and extrema timestamps for each bar.

It is also possible to add **custom metrics** to each bar using the `additional_metrics` parameter, see the [dedicated tutorial](/../data-aggregation/bar-metrics/#custom-metrics) for a detailed walkthrough.

<br>

**How It Works**

Each incoming tick contributes to a running total based on its **signed direction**:

\[
\text{Signed Tick} = 
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } P_t > P_{t-1} \\
-1 & \text{if } P_t < P_{t-1} \\
0  & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

A new bar is created **when the absolute value of the cumulative signed imbalance** exceeds the `expected_imbalance` threshold.

This type of bars comes from the book "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" (Marco Lopez de Prado)

=== "Function"
    ```python
    def ticks_to_tick_imbalance_bars(df: pd.DataFrame, expected_imbalance: int = 100, col_price: str = "price", col_volume: str = "volume",
        additional_metrics: List[Tuple[Callable, str, List[str]]] = []) -> pd.DataFrame
    ```
=== "Docstring"
    ```python
    """
    Convert tick-level data into tick imbalance bars, optionally enriched with custom metrics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        Tick DataFrame indexed by datetime, must include price and volume columns.
    expected_imbalance : int
        Cumulative signed tick imbalance threshold that triggers a new bar.
    col_price : str

## **Ticks to Volume Imbalance Bars**

The `ticks_to_volume_imbalance_bars` function creates bars based on **signed volume imbalance**. A new bar is triggered when the imbalance between buying and selling volume exceeds a predefined threshold.

This method captures **asymmetry in trading pressure**, allowing you to detect key moments where market participation is strongly biased in one direction â€” often before large price moves.

The function computes **OHLCV**, tick count, duration, extrema timestamps, and optionally, **custom metrics**.

It is also possible to add **custom metrics** to each bar using the `additional_metrics` parameter, see the [dedicated tutorial](/../data-aggregation/bar-metrics/#custom-metrics) for a detailed walkthrough.

<br>

**How It Works**

The volume imbalance is computed as:

\[
\text{Signed Volume}_t =
\begin{cases}
+V_t & \text{if } P_t > P_{t-1} \\
-V_t & \text{if } P_t < P_{t-1} \\
0    & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Where \( V_t \) is the tick volume at time \( t \).  
A new bar is created when the **cumulative sum** of signed volume exceeds `expected_imbalance`.

This type of bars comes from the book "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" (Marco Lopez de Prado)

=== "Function"
    ```python
    def ticks_to_volume_imbalance_bars(df: pd.DataFrame, expected_imbalance: float = 500_000, col_price: str = "price", col_volume: str = "volume",
        additional_metrics: List[Tuple[Callable[[np.ndarray], float], str, List[str]]] = []) -> pd.DataFrame
    ```
=== "Docstring"
    ```python
    """
