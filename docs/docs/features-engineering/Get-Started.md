# **Getting Started**

Feature engineering is a <u>crucial step</u> in **quantitative trading**. The **Quantreo library** provides several optimized functions to extract meaningful insights from raw market data.

To help you understand how to use each function, we provide **detailed explanations** and **Jupyter Notebook examples** in the [tutorials](/../tutorials/Quantreo-for-beginners)  folder.

!!! warning "ðŸ“¦ Installation & Import"
    Be sure you have installed the quantreo library before running any of these codes. To install it, just run ``pip install quantreo`` in your terminal.

    PS: to import the Features Library Package, you just need to run 
    ```python
    import quantreo.features_engineering as fe
    ```

## **Data Format**

Quantreo is designed to work with **OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data**, which is the standard format in financial markets.  


!!! success "ðŸ”— OHLCV focus"
    <u>**Not all features require all columns**</u>. So, if you compute a features needing only the high and the low prices, you can put a dataframe containing only these two variables.
     

Let's create really a very simple dataframe to show you the right format.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a sample OHLCV DataFrame
data = {
    "open": [100, 102, 101, 103, 105],
    "high": [105, 107, 106, 108, 110],
    "low": [98, 100, 99, 101, 102],
    "close": [102, 104, 103, 105, 107],
    "volume": [10000, 10050, 9950, 10000, 11500]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df)
```

| Open | High | Low | Close | Volume |
|------|------|-----|-------|--------|
| 100  | 105  |  98 |  102  | 10000  |
| 102  | 107  | 100 |  104  | 10050  |
| 101  | 106  |  99 |  103  | 9950   |
| 103  | 108  | 101 |  105  | 10000  |
| 105  | 110  | 102 |  107  | 11500  |
