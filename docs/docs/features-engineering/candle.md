## **Basic Candle Information**

The `candle_information` function provides essential insights about a candle by calculating the following features:

- **The Candle Way**: This feature returns `-1` if the candle is red (indicating a negative variation from the open price to the close price) or `1` if the candle is green (indicating a positive variation from the open price to the close price).

- **The Filling**: This feature computes the ratio between the absolute difference from the open to the close price and the total range of the candle (i.e., the difference between the high and low prices). $\frac{| \text{close} - \text{open} |}{| \text{high} - \text{low} |}$

- **The Amplitude**: This feature measures the relative price movement of a candle compared to its average. $\frac{| \text{close} - \text{open} |}{\left( \frac{\text{open} + \text{close}}{2} \right)}$

=== "Function"
    ```python
    fe.candle.candle_information(df: pd.DataFrame, open_col: str = 'open', high_col: str = 'high',
                           low_col: str = 'low', close_col: str = 'close')
    ```
=== "Docstring"
    ```python
    """
    Compute candle information indicators for a given OHLC DataFrame.
    
    This function calculates:
      - 'candle_way': Indicator for the candle's color (1 if close > open, -1 otherwise).
      - 'filling': The filling percentage, computed as the absolute difference between
                   close and open divided by the range (high - low).
      - 'amplitude': The candle amplitude as a percentage, calculated as the absolute difference
                     between close and open divided by the average of open and close, multiplied by 100.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame containing OHLC data.
    open_col : str, optional
        Column name for open prices (default is 'open').
    high_col : str, optional
        Column name for high prices (default is 'high').
    low_col : str, optional
        Column name for low prices (default is 'low').
    close_col : str, optional
        Column name for close prices (default is 'close').
    
    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[pd.Series, pd.Series, pd.Series]
        - candle_way (pd.Series[int]): The direction of the candle (`1` for bullish, `-1` for bearish).
        - filling (pd.Series[float]): The proportion of the candle range occupied by the body.
        - amplitude (pd.Series[float]): The relative size of the candle in percentage.
    """
    ```
=== "Example"
    ```python
    df["candle_way"], df["filling"], df["amplitude"] = fe.candle.candle_information(df=df, open_col="open",
    high_col="high", low_col="low", close_col="close")
    ```

ðŸ“¢ "For a practical example, check out the [educational notebook](/../tutorials/features-engineering-candle/#basic-candle-information)."

!!! tip "Tip"
    These three variables (`candle_way`, `filling` and `amplitude`) are often very correlated. Do not hesitate to keep only the best feature related to your problem or combine them smartly into one variable.

## **Spread Calculation**

The `compute_spread` function provides a simple yet valuable insight into the **difference between the highest and lowest price** within a given period. This metric is useful for analyzing intra-bar market volatility.

  $$ \text{spread} = \text{high} - \text{low} $$

The higher the `spread` value is, the more the market is volatile.

=== "Function"
    ```python
    fe.candle.compute_spread(df: pd.DataFrame, high_col: str = 'high', low_col: str = 'low')
    ```
=== "Docstring"
    ```python
    """
    Compute the spread between the high and low price columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame containing price data.
    high_col : str, optional
        Column name for the high prices (default is 'high').
    low_col : str, optional
        Column name for the low prices (default is 'low').

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.Series
        Series containing the spread values (high - low), indexed like the input DataFrame.
    """
    ```
=== "Example"
    ```python
    df["spread"] = fe.candle.compute_spread(df=df, high_col="high", low_col="low")
    ```

## **Price Distribution**

The `price_distribution` function calculates the **percentage of closing prices** that lie within a given **relative range** of their **rolling high-low interval**.

This feature is especially helpful to identify **price compression** (when many prices cluster in the center of the range) or **volatility bursts** (when price spreads out to the extremes).

It works by:

- Computing the **min** and **max** price in each rolling window.

- Evaluating the **number of prices** that fall between two dynamic thresholds: `start_percentage` (e.g., 0.25) of the range and `end_percentage` (e.g., 0.75) of the range


=== "Function"
    ```python
    fe.candle.price_distribution(df: pd.DataFrame, col: str = 'close', window_size: int = 60,
                                 start_percentage: float = 0.25, end_percentage: float = 0.75)
    ```
=== "Docstring"
    ```python
    """
    Compute the percentage of close prices within a relative range of their local low-high interval,
    over a rolling window.

    This function calculates, for each window, how many values lie within a given percentage band
    of the [low, high] range. It is useful to detect price compression or expansion.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        Input DataFrame containing the time series data.
    col : str
        Name of the column containing the close prices.
    window_size : int, optional
        Size of the rolling window (default is 60).
    start_percentage : float, optional
        Start of the relative range as a percentage of (high - low). Default is 0.25.
    end_percentage : float, optional
        End of the relative range as a percentage of (high - low). Default is 0.75.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.Series
        Series with the same index as the input, containing the computed percentage values for each window.
        The first (window_size - 1) rows will be NaN.
    """
    ```
=== "Example"
    ```python
    df["0_to_25"] = fe.candle.price_distribution(df, col="close", window_size=60,
                                                 start_percentage=0.0, end_percentage=0.25)
    df["25_to_75"] = fe.candle.price_distribution(df, col="close", window_size=60,
                                                  start_percentage=0.25, end_percentage=0.75)
    df["75_to_100"] = fe.candle.price_distribution(df, col="close", window_size=60,
                                                   start_percentage=0.75, end_percentage=1.0)
    ```

## **Internal Bar Strength**

The `internal_bar_strength` function computes the **relative position of the closing price within the bar's range**, making it a useful feature for detecting short-term **overbought or oversold conditions**.

IBS is especially relevant in **mean-reversion strategies** or when identifying **compression zones** within a bar.

The formula used is:

\[
\text{IBS} = \frac{\text{Close} - \text{Low}}{\text{High} - \text{Low}}
\]

- IBS close to **1** â†’ the price closed near the **high** of the day  
- IBS close to **0** â†’ the price closed near the **low** of the day  
- IBS around **0.5** â†’ the price closed in the **middle of the range**


=== "Function"
    ```python
    fe.candle.internal_bar_strength(df: pd.DataFrame, high_col: str = 'high',
                                    low_col: str = 'low', close_col: str = 'close')
    ```
=== "Docstring"
    ```python
    """
    Compute the Internal Bar Strength (IBS) indicator.

    The IBS is defined as:
        IBS = (Close - Low) / (High - Low)

    It measures where the closing price is located within the bar's range,
    and is commonly used to detect short-term overbought or oversold conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame containing OHLC data.
    high_col : str
        Name of the column representing the high price.
    low_col : str
        Name of the column representing the low price.
    close_col : str
        Name of the column representing the closing price.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.Series
        Series with the IBS values, indexed like the input DataFrame.
    """
    ```
=== "Example"
    ```python
    df["ibs"] = fe.candle.internal_bar_strength(df=df, high_col="high", low_col="low", close_col="close")
    ```

=== "Notes"
    !!! info
        - If `high` == `low`, then `IBS` = 0.5, which represents a neutral position within the range.
        - The `IBS` values should normally lie between **0 and 1**.  
          If you observe excessive values outside this range, it usually indicates issues in the input data (e.g., inconsistent OHLC values or misaligned candles).
